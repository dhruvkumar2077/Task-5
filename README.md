# Task 5 â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
The goal of this project is to perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset to identify patterns and factors that influenced passenger survival. The analysis combines **data cleaning, visualization, and statistical techniques** to generate meaningful insights.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **Python** â€“ Programming language for analysis  
- **Pandas** â€“ Data cleaning and manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** â€“ Visualization libraries  
- **Google Colab** â€“ Cloud-based notebook environment  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- **Titanic_EDA.ipynb** â€“ Jupyter Notebook with:  
  - Data preparation and handling missing values  
  - Visualizations of survival by gender, class, age, and fare  
  - Summary of key insights  

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- **Women had a higher survival rate than men**  
- **First-class passengers survived more often** than those in lower classes  
- **Higher ticket prices correlated with higher survival chances**  
- **Children and younger passengers** had better survival outcomes than adults
