# Task 5 â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
The goal of this project is to perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset to extract meaningful insights.  
The focus is on identifying patterns in survival rates based on factors like gender, class, age, and fare.
